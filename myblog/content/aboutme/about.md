<strong>Me:</strong><br>
<p>I'm Benjamin Torres. I go to UC Berkeley. I major in philosophy. Go Bears.</p>

<br>
<p>
<strong>Beliefs:</strong><br>
"Don't fake it till you make it. Be honest and hope you make it. The whole way." - <a href="https://youtu.be/_L3gNaAVjQ4?t=8034" target="_blank">Geohot</a><br>

Dating apps should be skilled based matchmaking.<br>

If what you are working on is not important and not likely to lead to important things, then why are you working on it?<br>

I will figure it out.<br>

In the future, the quality of life to be higher for everyone and every person will have better access to education (not necessarily in the form of universities today).<br>

When I die I won't be remembered for how much or how little money I made but rather for the things I did and how I treated people.<br>

I am celebrating life as much as I can.<br>

I hope to become a pillar of my community.<br>
I hope I give more than I take.
