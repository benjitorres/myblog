<p>I'm Benjamin Torres. I go to *the* <em>University of California</em>. I will gradute in 2024. I major in philosophy.</p>

<p>Why philosophy? Because I love it. Kinda. The more classes I take the more I love it less and less. I don't know why. I don't care a whole lot about details in philosophy or about <em>transcedental idealism</em> or any of these things. I care about learning the truth about hard questions but it seems like we never get there in philosophy because there are a lot of counter-examples. I wonder if I got into math more it would start feeling like philosophy.</p> 

<p>I'm slow at learning. I'm impatient also. Unlucky!</p>
