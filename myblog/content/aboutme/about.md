<p>I'm Benjamin Torres. I go to *the* <em>University of California</em>. I will gradute in 2024. I major in philosophy.</p>

<p>Why philosophy? Because I love it. Kinda. The more classes I take the more I love it less and less. I don't know why. I don't care a whole lot about details in philosophy or about <em>transcedental idealism</em> or any of these things. I care about learning the truth about hard questions but it seems like we never get there in philosophy because there are a lot of counter-examples. But here I am!</p> 

<p>I'm slow at learning. I'm impatient also. Unlucky!</p>

<strong>Ideals:</strong><br>
"Don't fake it till you make it. Be honest and hope you make it. The whole way." - <a href="https://youtu.be/_L3gNaAVjQ4?t=8034" target="_blank">Geohot</a><br>
I want to start a family and continue the "Torres" name. I want to get married. I want to fall in love.<br>
I hope to always be sincere and optimistic about the future. I hope when I die I'm not remembered for how much or how little money I made but rather for the things I did and how I treated people.<br>
I hope to make life long friends and meet with them to celebrate life as much as possible.<br>
I hope to become a pillar of my community.<br>
I hope I give more than I take.
