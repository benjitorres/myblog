<p>Hello, I'm Benjamin Torres. If you're reading this, I'm assuming you already know me. I'm going to list out the positives and negatives of getting into a relationship with me. The negatives are mainly physical and the positives are mainly personality-wise. The good thing is that 3/4 negatives can be fixed. I guess technically all of them can be fixed. And another good thing is that I think over time the positives will outweigh the negatives. If you want to know more about what I value then you can go to my <a target="_blank" href="https://baeaen.com/aboutme/about">values</a> section in my about me page. <br>

Positives:
1. romantic
2. funny
3. caring
4. empath
5. happy
6. optimistic
7. confident (adding to this everyday)
8. socially aware when it matters, maybe <br>

Negatives:
1. receding hairline (blame my dad)
2. fat (fixing this currently !!)
3. no therapy
4. no money (yet) <br>
