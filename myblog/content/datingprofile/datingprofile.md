<p>Hello, I'm Benjamin Torres. 

I'm going to list out the positives and negatives of getting into a relationship with me. The negatives are mainly physical and the positives are mainly personality-wise. The good thing is that 3 of 4 negatives can be fixed. The positives <b>will</b> outweigh the negatives. 

If you want to know more about what I value then you can go to my <a target="_blank" href="https://baeaen.com/aboutme/about">beliefs</a> section in my about me page. <br>

Positives:
1. romantic
2. funny
3. caring
4. empath
5. happy
6. optimistic
7. confident
8. socially aware when it matters<br>

Negatives:
1. receding hairline
2. fat
3. no therapy
4. no money (yet)
