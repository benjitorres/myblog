Thoughts I had this Halloween. All over the place.

I have to be honest with myself: I'm at one of the best universities and I haven't been developing any skills during my time here. Is this true? I don't know myself. I know that I want to change this. 

Why am I not spending more time thinking about what I want to accomplish and then go for that? It's really that simple they say. Maybe they're right.  

I say things to myself like "I want to win" but for what reason? It seems like I'm doing it for other people and not because I really care about these things. They sound good and they make me feel good but it's all empty because it's not me. Do I care about making a positive impact in the world? Do I care about helping people? Do I want to solve cool problems? 

I should spend more time thinking about it and choosing a topic to get deep into. Why? Why not just spend all my time thinking instead? Do I want to do work that changes history? Yes. Why? Because of the prestige. But I don't like working hard. Well change that. Why else do you want to do work that changes history? Because it seems like if I die in the process or if I do make a change in the course of history then I would have given more than taken. I think giving more than taking is a way of reaching happiness. Is changing history the only way to give more than take? I don't think so. 

Do I necessarily have to work on the hardest problems to be happy if happiness is my end goal? I don' think I do. And if I don't have to work on the hardest problems to be happy then what's the point? I can give in my own way. At least I think I can. 

"What can I do that will change the course of history?"

I think everyone should ask themselves this question but I'm not sure that if you don't end up changing history you don't deserve to live a good life or be happy. The only important thing is that you don't give up on trying to contribute to the world. 

Working at OpenAI seems cool for the fact that it's Sam Altman's thing. Paradigm just seems so much cooler tho. I want an internship for Paradigm by the end of nexet year for Security. Why OpenAI? so I can impress people the same way it's impressive tell people I go to <i>UC Berkeley</i>. Why Paradigm? Because it seems like they do cool things just based off the fact that people like samczsun can work there and not reveal their ID at all. Super cool place to work at it seems like even if no one understands it. 

I will do more focused writings later. I just wanted to write this quick thing and get it out today. 

As of writing this I'm wearing a bear costume on campus. Fun !
