Originally this was going to go on my "about me" page but I realized that it was too long. 

So why?

Because it was what I cared about the most and I thought I could have the biggest impact in this field. I wanted to make philosophy relevant again. 

I was curious about why it had died out as a field. The only famous philosophers alive today are people like Slavoj Žižek, Nick Bostrom, and David Chalmers. The reason for this is because they talk about interesting and real world problems. Žižek talks about politics. Bostrom talks about technology, understands it, and runs a research center. Chalmers talks about consciousness which is something everyone's always been interested in.

Universities don't teach interesting things anymore. At least not here at Cal. I'm learning about the philosophy of science and perception. To be clear, my professors are clearly passionate about these subject matters and that's great for them. No random person in the street wants to hear about my thoughts on substantivalism vs. relationalism or the sense-datum theory.

The only people who major in philosophy today are future lawyers and those who lie about wanting to become lawyers.

I should have gone into Classics. Classics and fiction seem to offer more truths about the world than philosophy today. If I went into Classics, I'm sure I'd have the same complaints. I'd have the same complaints had I gone into any field. I've had the same complaints about every kind of institution I've been a part of. This is a problem of how/what/why we teach in general.

Philosophy will always be one of my favorite things. Just outside of educational institutions. 

My favorite work by Bostrom is <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/papers/pascal.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Pascal's Mugging</em></a>
