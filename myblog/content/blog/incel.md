One of the first questions I asked her was "Do your parents think your innocent?" What a stupid question to ask. Who asks that kind of question??? LOSERS! I had already made assumptions about her just because she was pretty. I also knew that she likes raves so I assumed that she enjoyed drugs, sex, and parties in general. After I asked that stupid question I also found out that she's part of a sorority. Some guys reading this already made the assumptions that I made when I was in the middle of the conversation. But I'm not exactly framing this neutrally. I'm framing this the way that I perceived and connected things that weren't there. All I really knew was that she enjoyed raves and was pretty. Is this strong enough to make an assumption about the kind of person she is? Maybe for some people but it's not. Why is it not? I'm not sure yet.

It turns out that she does enjoys partying but she doesn't do drugs or participate in hooking up with random people. She joined a sorority not because of some shallow reason but because she's homesick and lonely so she wanted to form bonds with people. I always assumed that anyone who joins a frat/sorority does so because they all seek out the same thing: fun. This sort of fun is the kind that I don't engage in and I judge people who do. I should make less judgements and listen more. She's actually a cool person and the reason I don't interact with more people like her is because I isolate myself based on the assumptions I have about them. 

There's no chance I could have intellectualized myself to this position so I'm glad for the experience yesterday. I don't remember the last time I had a perspective shift and it feels really good. It feels freeing in a way. And I couldn't have done it without talking to a sorority member.  

To be clear, it was still a good conversation. We got a lot done as well. There's a lot more that went well during the conversation rather than poorly. I'm just pointing out the bad part because that's how my brain works. I'm trying to change that. 

I'm not sure what being an incel means anymore. Of course it obviously means involuntary celebate but there seems like a mentality attached with that. I noticed that in myself today and I'm not happy with it. It takes up a lot of energy thinking about negative things about people. Energy that could be useful elsewhere like in my paper due in a few days. I do accept my mentality otherwise I wouldn't be able to write about it as I am. 

Is it fixable? Yeah of course. It's clear that it is. How can I fix it? I should just make more friends and try to date more people and work on myself. There's always something I can do and I should stop chasing after women who don't feel attracted to me. Maybe this framing is part of the problem as well. This should be pretty simple and there's no reason I shouldn't be able to do it. 

Should I feel shame? I shouldn't. Do I? Yes. Part of the reason of writing this is because I know that it will force me to remove some shame by making it public.  

I don't have any skills that I picked up today. I don't like how people say python is the easiest language because it turns people off when they struggle at the beginning with things. Everything is a struggle but saying things like that and not letting people that conceptually things might be tough is strange. The language itself doesn't really matter. The one time I found the differences in languages was when I tried solving a problem in JS but I couldn't. I went over to python and solved it in a few seconds then applied the understanding of the problem to JS.

We should be teaching JS and python at the same time to show people the difference between a language like python and a language that has some C-style similarities like JS.
