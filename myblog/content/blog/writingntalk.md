My friend mentioned that she hears people talking and she stops focusing on what they're saying because she tries to keep track of how many times they say "UM" or "like". Once she catches on, she tries to predict when they're gonna say it and how often they say it when they're talking.This story is unrelated. Just a fun thing. 

I'm getting rid of "I think" & "I guess" & "maybe" and just saying what I mean. This way people will hold me to a higher standard when talking. People will ask me to prove that the things I'm saying are true. This will help me sound more confident. I'm curious to see if people will treat me different. 

When I start talking like this, people will then suggest their own ideas. It's not about communicating efficiently. That just so happens to be positive side effect!
