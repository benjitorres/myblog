Happy Thanksgiving !!! ðŸ¦ƒ

Is a function the relationship between an input and an output? I think so but it doesn't belong to one variable. A function isn't a mathematical symbol right? Maybe this is why I have so much trouble with them? Maybe it's a higher level of abstraction that I never bothered with. Well I do want to bother with it now. 

What's an example? If "x = y", the function is the relationship between x and y. So if it's plotted on a graph then it's linear. The graph is a visual description of the function right? 

How much of math belongs to a higher abstraction level that I didn't see before? Is this true?

Tinder experiment didn't work out. Unlucky! Did I learn anything? Don't think so. Well I learned that I may like someone because I was hesitant creating an account once I got here. I didn't even get rejected. I didn't get a single person to like me back so I could send them a message (there was one person but I never sent a message because they seemed like a bot).
