Time feels strange. It's only 10pm but it feels a lot, lot later. 

I haven't given up but I've moved on from her. It wasn't going to work out but at least I have the clarity now. I'm seeing a pattern in myself and in the way I conduct friendships. I feel very impatient. I have to learn how to be more patient.

I have big trouble communicating as well. I was shaking while talking to her and I'm not sure why. I've been told I have a "don't give a fuck" attitude and that I'm dismissive. I don't like this about myself. I want to change it. 

I love and care about a lot of things. It's just hard for me to show it. I'm a lot better now than I was a few months ago. 

Who am I comparing myself to? I think I spend too much time thinking about others, people I don't actually know and even people I know. 

My friend deals with sadness by praying and I do it by writing about a hopeful future. I think both of these things are the same. 

Why does it feel like googling for programming help is cheating?
