Solution 1: make philosophy 100x harder to declare as a major. force everyone to complete a thesis by their last year otherwise they don't graduate. 

Solution 2: ask students what they want to learn about, compress it into a few choices, and then it's student lead instead of professionals

Solution 3: get rid of the philosophy department
