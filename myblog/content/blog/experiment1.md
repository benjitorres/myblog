How many girls will I get to go on dates with me when I make a Tinder account?

This is the question I will answer when I visit one of my best friends.

Why? I feel lonely and I feel like having a girlfriend will fix some of my loneliness. I never understood why I want to get into a relationship so badly. My friend suggested that it's because I want "validation" but that doesn't work for me because it means I'm admitting that I can't do everything myself. I think this is a strange way to view the world because most of things that I use on the day to day aren't made by me. I didn't make the buses I ride in..or make the phone I use..or make the music I listen to..I didn't make the keyboard I'm typying this on or the computer I'm using..I'm just plagiarizing Steve Jobs but you get the point. Maybe I do want validation. I think I just want a more intimate best friend. 

How? Swiping 100 times. I'm sure not whether left or right. We'll see how far it gets me but I'm willing to try. This could end poorly. It could end with me crying over the fact that I got rejected 100 times. The funny thing is that this is the worst thing that can happen. Do I enjoy witnessing my own suffering? It only takes one acceptance from someone to make all the rejections worth it. We'll see how it goes. It should be a fun Thanksgiving!

My handsome, smart, and kind friend says he didn't get much traction on there which I find hard to believe. I wouldn't say I'm handsome since I'm fat or smart since I study philosophy or kind because I don't give more than I take. But for some reason, I believe I will succeed. Maybe this expectation is what will make me the saddest.

<b>Some unrelated thoughts</b>:

It's 15 past 12 so please forgive my dramatic self. 

I feel bad for the way I conducted things with my crush. I knew what the worst outcome was going to be but I wasn't aware of the side effects, for the lack of a better term, that came with it. The worst outcome: being rejected. The side-effects: her feeling uncomfortable around me, me feeling sad and awkward in a shared space, unsure about whether or not other people are still cool with me and to what extent. Not only is it a shared space but it's also her place of employment and a place I enjoy spending time in because I get work done and have met some really cool people. I'm sure that if this wasn't her place of work she wouldn't be there anymore and I just feel sad that I caused that. I still feel some sadness but I think it's partly caused by my tiredness at the moment. 

What did I learn from it? I really don't like people who don't say what they want. If I get no response I should assume it's a no even if it kills me not having an absolute answer. Sometimes I wish talking to a girl was like a program where I give an input and get an output immediately. Maybe it is with the right one. I truly hope I get better at communication and don't make more people uncomfortable. Good friends will stick around even after making mistakes. I shouldn't be as closed off as I seem.
