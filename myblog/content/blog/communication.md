I should be working on my final but it doesn't feel really important. But then again neither does watching Palmer Luckey interviews. 

I'm not clear when I communicate with others. It all feels so clear in my head but there's such a big level of delusion that I don't see until I'm confronted with explaining something to someone. I struggle all the time to say the correct things. It's possible that I know nothing at all. 

I want to get better at communicating but there seems to be no good search result when I look up "how to communicate better". It's all just blogs from random people who want you to share their articles. No static sites written in Times New Roman to tell me how to get better. Maybe I just have to think more. 

Maybe I should join a debate club or something. That seems like it would improve my communication a lot. I'm not sure why I'm so bad at communicating now. It seems like I've gotten worse at it but it could just be that I'm doing more talking now so it just feeels like I've gotten worse. I could be getting better. We'll see.
