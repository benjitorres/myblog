<h3>I have a problem. I think I'm wireheading myself and have been doing so all these years. </h3>

<b>Problem</b>: watching people do things I can't but can learn over time satiates my desire to do things myself.

<b>Solution</b>: stop watching people do things that I can learn to do and do them myself. Go to a zoo instead and look at the monkeys. 

<b>Why is it a problem?</b> It's a problem because I don't get anything done. If I think about how this year went, I would say it's pretty positive. I got into my dream school, made friends, have a blog, am working on things like whittling and this blog. If I were to write things down on what I accomplished I'm not sure I'd be able to say I did anything that I'm proud of besides making friends and getting into this school.

The year isn't over yet so I'm interested to see what I'll be able to get done. I'm not giving up yet. 

<b>Example</b>: I watched this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrxicEWGcfI" target="_blank">intro to hacking</a> video and I thought it was great. I watched it several months ago and they had their own resources. Why didn't I join the discord? The video has +200k views but their discord has 1k members. Why is it so low? How many people who watched the video say they want to learn how to hack things? Maybe there's a big hole that I don't see as missing. I'm part of the problem. I'm upset.

<b>Actions</b> I have a "goals for 2023" list that I will upload once the year is closing. The semester is almost over and I'll be able to just get work done and then I can work on stuff for myself. I won't spoil what's on the list but I think next year will be better than this year. 

This year has been very good to me so far.
