V-arc = Vim + arc <br>

<b>What?</b> It's just the browser arc combined with the simplicity of Vim instead of something like Notion. I just get the vibe that it's like the Notion browser. I just use TextEdit because it's so simple and I can just use it the way I want. I don't want to customize something so much just to get the same usefulness that already exists in other browsers. If I take away from the browser then I will get so much. <br>

<b>Why?</b> Becuase arc is beautiful and Vim is so fundamental that there's no need to use anything else. I find myself opening Vim at least once a day because it's so simple to use. I wish arc was more like this and based on the fact that it's like Notion makes it so that I have no use for it.<br>

<b>Why arc?</b> The arc browser is beautiful and it looks very cool. It's not really for me tho and I want to help it out. I think more people would use something beautiful if it was simpler to use just because it's beautiful.<br>

<b>Problem?</b> The problem is that it's so feature heavy. It's like having a note taker like Notion and you use something like Notes or Notepad or TextEdit. It's just the simplest thing and I want to be able to use this more. 
<br>

<b>How?</b> Doesn't seem like arc is open. Unlucky, I don't know why. I'm not sure why you would do this. I think it's based on Chromium. We can make Vhromium lmao. Get the domain ! And make the website.
