I was watching Palmer Luckey interviews. He seems like a really cool dude who gets stuff done.

Hearing about Anduril got me to think about why we haven't had high speed trains yet. It seems like maybe a startup can do this? It seems related to Anduril because they're not using tax payers money to build tools to sell to the government. It seems like Anduril is building tools using their own money and then selling based on what already works. I'm not sure why we can't do this with rails.

<strong>Some important questions to consider</strong>:

Why does it cost so much to build here?

Can we make it cheaper by building it ourselves?

It already exists in other parts of the world. Can we just copy them?

Why does it have to be built with tax payer money?

Is it a tech problem? Is it hardware?

<strong> Some important points to consider</strong>:

Should be cheaper/more efficient when compared to a flight

99% that will fail (otherwise it would already exist, right?)

Should expand to Canada and Mexico

Why is America so behind? Do we not care? Can we make people care?

Once this idea came to mind I got some anxiety. I get anxiety about failure, not getting anyone to believe in this idea, becoming vaporware and never making it a reality. Why do I have so much anxiety about this? Is it doable? How much physics do I have to learn? Do I have to understand how the engines work? Who should I model this based off? How much will I have to deal with regulation because I really don't care about that if I'm honest. Am I smart enough? Is this the best usage of my time? (Well it is better than spending my time not trying to make the world a better place.) I'm just scared.
