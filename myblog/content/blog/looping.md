Life is looping. Life is a loop. Think of tree rings. It's not a linear graph. You start off from the center as a small thing and then create circles around your life until you die. 

I'm unsure of the time thing in how long the circles take. This is why things loop. It's not about I just know that circles is a good way of looking at things. Is it actually a good way of looking at things? I'm not sure. I just know it's a way to view things. 

Every sun rise is a new day. I learned in philosophy of science that we assume the universe started off at a low entropy point and we're heading out towards a high entropy point. We can see the tree things as that because they start small and and start going out as time goes by. 

Why is the linear graph a problem?

It seems like people fixate on this idea that life will peak up to a certain point. It seems like people think of marriage or careers in this way. Like at some point, we'll have "made it". I don't accept this. Life is a loop so every day you're making life-changing decisions. Everyday is as meaningful but maybe not as meaningful as the last. The linear graph is maybe a bigger problem given our values. The values like always climbing and getting to the higher status. I don't think that's worth the cost.  

I'll keep trying to apply this to my life and see how it goes. It's worth always trying. 

We shouldn't just settle for what came to us. We should always be pushing things around. There's no way that life is this unmalleable. 

People overcomplicate things and the questions they ask don't seem to patch any of the holes the way they think they do. Questions of purpose are good and curiosity is good but why don't we ask whether this is the right question to ask? 

We overcomplicate things. We shouldn't overcomplicate things. There is no answer the universe can give you that will make you satisfied. You should appreciate the inconsistencies. Try to fix them if you must but don't let it consume you. One way to patch the holes is to live a perfectly consistent life. This is impossible unless you decide to not interact with anyone and don't go outside. Don't do this to yourself. You'll see that the consistent life isn't worth it. It requires too much of you. In this short amount of time, do you think it's necessary that you solve this problem? Is it helpful for people?

Don't give up and stop searching. You should value more things than just the meaning of life. Like getting pizza with a friend or wearing a different sock on each foot. These things have more meaning to me than trying to answer the meaning of life. The meaning is meaningless. If you struggle finding it, that means you're overthinking it. Don't overthink it and you'll find it. And you'll realize that it doesn't matter. That it won't add anything to your life. Doing things will. Engaging in the real world will. Have fun and work hard. 

I learned about defining functions. I still kinda struggle but I'll get better as a right more. The simplest example they give is this: 

def square(x):
return(x * x)

We basically define "square" to mean that for any value x, if we apply the function "square" to it, we'll get back the square of X. For example:

def square(x):
    return(x * x)

print(square(2))

If we run this program in python, we'll get back 4 because the square of 2 is 4. X just stands for an integer. X isn't a real thing. It's pretty easy to understand when you think of it as defining a word and then when you use the function it's like using the word in a sentence. The word has to make sense in the sentence otherwise the sentence won't work.
