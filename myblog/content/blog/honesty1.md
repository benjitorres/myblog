1. The girl I like doesn't like me. 

2. I don't know why I want to be in a relationship in the first place. 

3. I get easily bored by things like math, science, computers, economics, philosophy, religion, and biology. 

4. I don't care to learn new things. 

5. I'm not depressed.

6. I am happy with my life.

7. I'm terribly impatient.  

What do I want? I want to feel like I know a lot. I want to feel like I'm better than other people at things. And I want to be able to prove these things. I want to be useful and irreplaceable to other people. I want to be unique. I don't think I have to be unique to get here but maybe I do. I'm perfectly happy being normal. I want develop new hobbies so the next time a girl asks me what I like to do then I can say that I enjoy doing/making things. 

I'm not so sure that I'm stubborn but I'm still gonna try out CS and math and see what I get from them. I'm not sure that there is a "best" in philosophy or math or CS so I'm not sure that I care that much about them. I'm not sure there is a single metric used in any field that can definitively measure whether someone's better at the same thing besides competitions like sports and CTFs. This is why I want to try to do CTFs. I want to learn hacking things because it seems good for my impatient brain. It seems like good stories can come from it like <a href="https://samczsun.com/escaping-the-dark-forest/" target="blank_">Escaping the Dark Forest</a>. I want to do research  and work in security at Paradigm like <a href="https://twitter.com/samczsun" target="blank_">samczsun</a> because he seems like a cool dude and like he does cool things.  

What's one of the problems with philosophy? It just feels like there's no weight to anything. Like one person can know more in one field than another and it doesn't matter because there isn't one canon. It's all based on what's popular in the universities at a given moment. I don't like this framework because it means that it's just a rotating thing that doesn't improve. There are no more improvements to make to philosophy. I can't become an impressive person in this field. 

Hacking and security skills are the ones I want. I want to be better than some attacker by playing perfect defense. 

I'm not sure why I'm making my life more complicated than it has to be. 

Like with the girl stuff. Am I upset that she doesn't like me and do I want to change her mind? Yeah I do but for what purpose? Do I really want to be in a relationship? I'm perfectly happy making friendships. If there's one reason why I want to be in a relationship it's because it feels good to have someone like a best friend in a more intimate way.

Why Honesty part 1? Because I will always come back and be honest with myself whether I feel like it's time for a change. And I will do this regardless of whether or not this blog exists.
