Not much to say. Just a lot of feelings. Over the Wire stuff is getting harder finally. Had to look up how to answer the thing cause I got stuck at the RSA key part. I knew I had to change it somehow but I just didn't know how or what to do afterwards. 

I keep crumbling around my crush and not in a good way. I have to move on. I drank for the first time yesterday and it was fun. I feel like drinking again cause it made me less worried. I feel that I can become this way at all times without needing to drink and that makes me hopeful. I didn't drink for me I drank to bond with a friend. I heard drinking was good for bonding. I'm not so sure but it was a fun experience. 

I'm just sad. Sad that things didn't work out my way. Sad that I don't know anything of how she feels but I think I can guess. I have doubts tho. Does she hate the person I am? Does she wish I never came back? Does she feel sympathy for me? Is she just afraid of hurting my feelings? How am I supposed to interpret the hints? Should I pretend like it never happened? I'm not that kind of person. I just have to avoid her but I also want to clear the air because it feels like the professional thing to do. I also don't want to bother her. Any time I see her now she's always hanging out with someone so I should probably just avoid her as much as possible. It just sucks. I'm not sure how to get rid of this feeling. Everyone knows the feeling and only with time will it go away. I have to indulge in the feeling. I can't just stay like this forever. I've been through this once before.

Why did I have to fail? If I knew I was going to fail I wouldn't have tried. I just feel like sulking but there's work to do. 

I have staff hours tomorrow and I think we have the same time but I might be wrong. Wish me luck.
