There was an event today at Cal. It was a hack day at the club I'm a part of. It felt embarrasing and I understand what people mean by imposter syndrome. The thing is that it's not imposter syndrome. I'm literally an imposter. I have no skills. 

I'm protected so much by online figures that I don't have any thing to offer myself. At least for right now. I have to learn more and work harder. I have to stop pretending I know things. 

At least no computer skills. It feels bad. It doesn't feel good. I tried using react to make a calendar and it failed. I don't like how react uses libraries to do anything. I'm not sure why I can't just use html/css. I know being a software engineer is about not giving up but there was nothing that I was understanding. Maybe I would understand more now. I do feel like I can read code better now. I don't entirely freak out and I'm getting better at reading errors. I just have to not give up so much. 

Is it overwhelming me? Possibly. It feels like I'm trying to build a rocket when I barely understand arithmetic and physics. Eventually I do have to take that jump and try to build rockets. For now, I must learn more arithmetic and physics. I shouldn't do this forever. I must start building rockets at some point. 

One thing I did poorly today was not asking questions when I needed it. I'm not sure what I'm embarrased for. I should be asking more questions. 

One thing that did go well today was the fact that I'm closer to being done with the group project and I can feel things coming together in the next two weeks. 

No new code lesson learned.
